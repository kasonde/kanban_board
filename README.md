# I love kanban boards!

As the title suggests, I love Kanban Boards. For my first side project to test my front-end web development skills, I decided that I want to build a tool I could use to be my task manager. I already use tools like [Notion](https://notion.so) for my task management and it's incredible. But this isn't anywhere near that, although it's **heavily** inspired by it ðŸ˜ƒ.
